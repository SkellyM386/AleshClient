# AleshClient
Alesh Posts stuff on his youtube and most people I run into that are new and don't know what or how to use discord.js-commando so this basically does what Alesh does with his command handler and the usage is pretty simple.<hr />
<br />

<h1>example usage</h1>

```js
const Client = require('./clientBase');

const client = new Client({}, 'commands', require('./config.json'));

```
